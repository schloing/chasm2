## Introduction

Bring C to the web! An attempt at something like React and Pyscript but for C.
Why? ██████ ██ █████ ███ ███████ ███ ████ (error loading text content, please try again later)

## Installation

Using chasm (at its current stage) is exceptionally easy (aka impossible). 
It is currently not possible to run the `build_run.sh` bash script, as the `build` directory is not in the repo.
When `chasm` is ready to be "used" run the following in your terminal.

```bash
# cd to chasm root
$ sh build_run.sh
```
